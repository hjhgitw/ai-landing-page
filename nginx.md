# Setting Up Nginx as a Service on macOS

To start Nginx as a service on macOS, you can create a launch daemon plist file. This will ensure that Nginx starts automatically at boot time and can be managed like a service. Here's how you can do it:

### 1. Create the Launch Daemon Plist File

Create a new plist file for Nginx in the `/Library/LaunchDaemons` directory:

```bash
sudo vi /Library/LaunchDaemons/nginx.plist



sudo launchctl stop nginx
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/nginx.plist


sudo launchctl list | grep nginx


sudo nginx -s reload
